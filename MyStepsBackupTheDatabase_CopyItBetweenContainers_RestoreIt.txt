#start the docker container (sql2), using port 1433, which means i should have created
#sql1 on a different port so that they could be up at the same time
sudo docker start sql2

#first, create the database (dockerBackUpRestoreTest)

#second, create table (dummy)

#third, insert a single row into the table ('Hello')

#fourth, create new directory location to hold the backup
#THIS IS WHERE I BANGED MY HEAD AGAINST THE DESK FOR 2 HOURS
#...you need to think about the container having its own directory system...
#i was thinking as if it was all one and the same even though i actually know better
#had an AH HA moment when i remembered that....sooooooo skip to #How to do it right
  #show what is in current directory
  sudo ls
  #show current directory name and path
  sudo pwd
  #create new common directory folder under my user name
  sudo mkdir backups
  #navigate into the new folder
  cd /home/cameron/backups
  #verify it is usable
  sudo pwd

	#how to do it right - technically happened after i finished step 5
	#enter the docker file/directory system
	docker exec -it sql2 bash
	ls
	cd var
	ls
	cd opt
	ls
	cd mssql
	cd backups
	##BOOM FOUND THE BACKUP I TOOK.....

#fifth, take a SQL database backup and store it in the new directory
backup database dockerBackUpRestoreTest to disk='/var/opt/mssql/backups/dockerBackupRestoreTest.bak' with noformat, nowait, name='dockerBackupRestoreTest',skip, nounload, norewind,stats=10

#sixth, copy the backup from the docker container to the linux host directory
docker cp sql2:/var/opt/mssql/backups/dockerBackupRestoreTest.bak /var/opt/mssql/backups

#seventh, offline the sql2 container (since i made all containers on port 1433 like a noob, only one could use the port at a time)
docker stop sql2

#eigth, start the sql 1 container
docker start sql1

#ninth copy the back from the linux host directory into the sql1 container
docker cp /var/opt/mssql/backups/dockerBackupRestoreTest.bak sql2:/var/opt/mssql

#tenth, restore the database into sql server on the sql1 container
restore database dockerBackupRestoreTest from disk='/var/opt/mssql/dockerBackupRestoreTest.bak' withrecovery;
